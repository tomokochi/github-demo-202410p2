Version Control Best Practice

1. Create an issue starting with following type indicator:
    feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
    fix: A bug fix
    style: Feature and updates related to styling
    refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
    test: Everything related to testing
    docs: Everything related to documentation
    chore: Regular code maintenance.
2. Create a new branch with the issue id (issue + issue id). 
    Always code inside this branch.
3. When you do a commit follow these simple rules:
    Specify the type of commit using the type indicator above;
    Always indicate the issue id;
    Provide a short description of what you did.
